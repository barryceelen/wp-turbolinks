# WordPress Turlobinks

Using [Turbolinks](https://github.com/rails/turbolinks) can make following links in your WordPress site ðŸš€ faster.
This plugin:

- Enqueues Turbolinks
- Adds the `Turbolinks-Location` header.

I consider this plugin a "note to self" and it is _not_ intended to automatically make Turbolinks work on your site.
