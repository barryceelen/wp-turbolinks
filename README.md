# WordPress Turlobinks

Using [Turbolinks](https://github.com/rails/turbolinks) can make following links in your WordPress site 🚀 faster.

- Enqueues Turbolinks
- Adds the `Turbolinks-Location` header.

I consider this plugin a "note to self" and it is _not_ intended (any more) to be a plugin to make Turbolinks work on your site automatically.
